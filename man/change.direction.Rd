\usage{
change.direction(changes, directions, tolerance)
}
\arguments{
\item{changes}{A list as returned by \code{\link{genelines}} or \code{\link{genelinesLog2FC}}.}

\item{directions}{A named list of the desired directions for each comparison. Names should correspond to the column names in \emph{changes$slopes}. Can contain the values "up", "down" and "flat".}

\item{tolerance}{A single number corresponding to how much above/below each value in \emph{directions} a gene may be and still be returned.}
}
\value{
A list of two data frames: the first contains the mean value of each treatment group for the scaled and centred counts of each gene, and the second contains the differences between pairs of treatment levels.
}
\description{
Find genes with a given direction of expression change
}
\details{
The differences between pairs of treatment levels is equivalent to the slope of a line drawn between the treatment means. \emph{change.direction} allows the user to define a set of relationships between treatments and find which genes follow these relationships. The amount of deviation allowed is determined by \emph{tolerance}, i.e. a tolerance of 0.2 means that a slope of > 0.2 will count as "up", a slope of < -0.2 will count as "down", and a slope between -0.2 to 0.2 (inclusive) will count as "flat".

\examples{
genes<-matrix(round(rnorm(n=600, mean=100, sd=10), 0),
ncol = 6, dimnames = list(paste0("g", seq(1:100))))
treats<-as.factor(c(rep("control",3), rep("treated",3)))
changes<-genelines(genes, treats)
change.direction(changes, directions = list(C1_2 = "up"), tolerance = 0.2)
change.direction(changes, directions = list(C1_2 = "down"), tolerance = 0.2)
change.direction(changes, directions = list(C1_2 = "flat"), tolerance = 0.2)
